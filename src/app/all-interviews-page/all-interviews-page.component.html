                "I started backpacking by accident.
                Growing up in Kitchener, even though I had heard of backpacking and have met people who
                told me about their inspiring stories, I thought thatis a world that I would never ever get a chance to
                enter. During the first year, I had a 4 month summer break which is the only summer off in my
                program and I was keenly looking for something special to do."

It was super last minute that I got matched with Ukraine. Back then, I didn’t even have a passport, and I literally received my passport 3 days before my flight.
