                I started backpacking by accident.
                Growing up in Kitchener, even though I had heard of backpacking and have met people who
                told me about their inspiring stories, I thought thatis a world that I would never ever get a chance to
                enter. During the first year, I had a 4 month summer break which is the only summer off in my
                program and I was keenly looking for something special to do.

                I really like the mix of culture and nature you could get with visiting these two countries, and they’re both popular backpacking destinations.

                If this is your first time, it might be scary but it is definitely a life changing experience.
                You learn so much about yourself as well about the culture and customs of the places you visit. Do it once and 
                you’ll be hooked like the rest of us.

                Most of the things I wished I knew prior to backpacking could not be taught because it’s one of those things you just need to go through before you know.

                Be comfortable with your plans and your style of travelling, because there's going to be complications and you want to deal with them in a good state of mind.

                  You make friends so easily, even if you are only with them for a couple of days. The friendship seem like it started many years ago, but really it started a couple hours/days ago.
