        <h4 class="pt-3">
          University of Waterloo Backpacker’s Associations (UWBA) is a student run club founded in
          September 2018 at the University of Waterloo. We teach students how to travel economically,
          and meet others of similar interest!
        </h4>
        <h4>
          We created an online magazine to put the spotlight on students who have gone out of their
          comfort zone to travel the world. We ask them essential questions to curate their tips and
          gain insights on their motivations to inspire the rest of us!

      "People ask why I travel alone - the answer is simple: I get to interact and chill with hostel mates from all over the globe who are like-minded and have incredible experiences to share.
      Every year, I plan to conquer one continent and as such, South America is due next year!
      My travels are always very adventurous and spontaneous (i.e. whale watching, quad biking, trekking etc) and could never do a boring day!"

      "Why do I love travelling!!??? - If you know me well, you should know how much I love photography. I wouldn’t leave from a trip without having taken 2000 pictures at least.
      Not for Instagram but for my own sake because I smile every time I look back at all the memories I have on my phone. And that’s what reminds me to keep going in life because amazing things DO HAPPEN!!!"

      "I love backpacking because I love the sense of freedom and spontaneity.
      I love being able to book a flight or bus to the next adventure without a single concrete plan, because I can. Or taking as many or as little stops along the way or even take the trip in a whole new direction, because I can.
      And since I’m the type of person that will sleep bare on the beach if it means a few more days of traveling, backpacking was really the only type of traveling for me."
