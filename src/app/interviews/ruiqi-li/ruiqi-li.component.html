            What inspired you to start backpacking?
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                I started backpacking by accident. Growing up in Kitchener, even though I had heard of backpacking and have met people who told me about their inspiring stories, 
                I thought that is a world that I would never ever get a chance to enter.During the first year, I had a 4 month summer break which is the only summer off in my program 
                and I was keenly looking for something special to do. By coincidence, I was looking on Aiesec, which is a worldwide organization that help students find internships or 
                work experience abroad.It was super last minute that I got matched with Ukraine. Back then, I didn't even have a passport, and I literally received my passport 3 days 
                before my flight.I was really naive at that time, and I did not know what was there waiting for me.It turned out that the journey totally changed my life. 
                In that program, I worked at the same place for 5 weeks, making a lot of friends with local people and students from all over the world.And then after the 5 weeks, I 
                backpacked with those friends for 3 weeks in Europe, which was the best experience of my life.

            What does a typical day when you’re backpacking look like?
          </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-6">
                    Well, I am a super spontaneous person, I might not have a typical day. It usually starts with me waking up really 
                    late.And then I would go on Trip Advisor to search for what to do.I would usually look up the best restaurants in the city because 
                    I am a huge traveller foodie.And then I would wake up my friends to have breakfast in hostel.I 100% recommend to stay in a hostel 
                    when traveling because it is a great chance to meet people.Breakfast is often provided for free at hostel and all the travellers 
                    would be at the same place for breakfast, which I found it the best chance to meet and talk to people. I usually just go to the 
                    breakfast and say something like “Hey, could you please pass me the jam.” to start a conversation. It is important to know that 
                    you won’t be able to get all the information online.If you do, it is probably sponsored.The best advice you can get is through talking to other travelers or local people.

            What’s something interesting that you bring on your trips?
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                Polaroid - what i love is giving strangers I met a piece of our memory who I probably will never see again.That polorioaed is 
                living proof that our memories are real. In the future, I might even pass you on the streets, maybe of New York, and we probably won’t even 
                recognise each other.Because the person we become will never be the same as the the childish, foolish, crazy one in our Polaroids. 
                Also, it the person in our polaroid we will never meet again, it is a snapshot of who we were at exactly that time no matter how much we change later.

            What are the most common challenges for students to go backpacking?
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                Time: I believe that if you love something, you would wake up wanting to do it tomorrow. For me, my biggest passion is travelling, so I will find time to travel,
                just like how everyone else will find time to watch netflix.
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                Finance: There are plenty of ways to travel on a budget. With $1,000 and some travel budget management skills, you can basically go anywhere 
                in the world.If you just make a small change to your spending, saving $100 per month, it could be easy as giving up Bubble Tea, you would be able to save $1, 000 
                for 10 months and can support yourself an once-in -life travel you’ve been dreaming of.

                Safety: I was very bold that I have been to some quite dangerous places, like anti-government concert in Santiago in Chile or streets with tear gas, 
                fire ash and burnt after protest in Valparaiso in Chile. I was lucky enough to survive or be helped every time.Like when I was walking at 
                Downtown Valparaiso, local residents, who do not speak English, used their body language to tell us not to go down the street anymore.When we happened 
                to walk into some dangerous areas, we ask those security guard for direction and they just left their work and walk with us to the safe area.
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                One tip I have to mention is that - try to use all the opportunities toconnect to people who speak the same language when you are at somewhere risky.  
                But, if you do not go to somewhere risky, the odds of getting hurt is very small, if you have the awareness of protecting yourself and asking for help.

                Company: it is hard to find a travel company because who you are with will completely determine your experience.I have traveled with multiple people before.  
                Everytime we have amazing memories but also a lot of problems.I am still good friends with them after the trip, but just be careful  
                when you are selecting your travel company.It is important to communicate and know about what kind of travelers they are and what they expect from the trip.  
                From my stories, you vff can probably see that I am a very open-minded and adventurous person who wants to talk to everyone and exploring  
                exotic places, so I would get disappointed if my company is more sheltered and less willing to take the risk.

            Any other advice for backpacking newbies?
          </p>
          <p class="answer_text">
                You don‘t have to be the craziest person that goes to the most exotic destination that you are not comfortable with. Honestly, 
                just start from anywhere that you are curious about.Part of the important lesson to learn from backpacking is to be in a situation 
                where you can be independent and you can make choices completely yourself, this is the best way to grow. Take care of your belongings, 
                especially your passport and your phone.Not every country is safe like Canada.I don’t think you can perfectly prepare for your 
                backpacking trip, just have a positive mindset all the time, and always have fun!
